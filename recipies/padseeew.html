    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Popular Thai street food that is quite easy to make at home! Made with chewy pan-fried rice noodles.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz Protein of your choice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>4 Clove Garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>4-6 Stalks Chinese Broccoli</li>
            <li>1lb fresh wide Rice Noodles</li>
            <li>4 tsp Sugar</li>
            <li>Ground White Pepper</li>
            <li>Prik Nam Som or Chili Vinegar (optional)</li>
            <strong>Sauce</strong>
            <li>2 tbsp Oyster Sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp Fish Sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp Golden Mountain Sauce (sub more soy sauce)</li>
            <li>2 tsp Thai Black Soy Sauce or Dark Soy Sauce</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the meat and soy sauce together well, then add about 2 tsp of oil and stir to coat the meat; this will help the meat separate when you go to cook it. Let the meat sit while you prep other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine all sauce ingredients together and stir to mix well.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp of the vegetable oil in a wok or a large non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add all of the protein and cook just until done. Remove meat from pan and set aside in a small bowl. If there is meat juices left in the wok, wipe it with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>From this step onward, I recommend cooking 1 portion at a time for best result: Add 1½ Tbsp vegetable oil and garlic to the wok and sauté over medium high heat until the smallest bits of garlic starts to turn colour.</li>
            <li>Add egg, break the yolk, let it set just about halfway, then scramble briefly.</li>
            <li>Add Chinese broccoli and toss to coat it evenly in the oil, about 10-15 seconds</li>
            <li>Ad 8oz rice noodles, 2 tbsp + 1 tsp of the sauce mix, and 2 tsp of sugar. Turn the heat up to high and toss to coat the noodles evenly in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Once coated spread the noodles out to cover the entire pan and let them sit without stirring for about 15-30 seconds until some of the noodles have "toasted" i.e. habe some charred marks on them (how long this takes depends on how hot your stove gets). Flip the noodles and let them sit again to toast the other side. You may flip the noodles again a couple more times to get more toasting if you wish.</li>
            <li>Add 1 portion of the cooked protein back into the pan, being careful not to add any meat juices that has accumulated in the bowl, and toss briefly to mix and heat up the protein.</li>
            <li>Plate the noodles, then quickly wipe the pan clean with paper towel and coock the next serving.</li>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Cooking 1 portion at a time is a bit more work, but it is well worth it. If there is too much noodles piled in the wok, it'll trap a lot of steam, and the moisture will prevent the noodles from toasting and developing that nice "wok char" flavour that is iconc to Pad See Ew. It might also cause your noodles to be wet and potentially mushy. Each portion only takes a few minutes to cook, so if you've got all the ingrediencts prepped and ready to go, everything will still be hot when everyone is ready to eat!

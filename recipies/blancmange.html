        <p>A retro, milky dessert according to BBC Goodfood. Gelatenous cake infused with lemon, and topped with berries for a perfect anytime treat!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
                <li>10 Sheets of gelatine</li>
                <li>40g Cornflour</li>
                <li>1.2L whole milk</li>
                <li>4 large lemons, zest peeled</li>
                <li>300g Caster Sugar</li>
                <li>150g mixed fresh berries (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Oil a 1.2-1.5 litre jelly mould, then set aside. Soak the gelatine in cold water following pack instructions. Mix together the cornflour with 6 tbsp of the milk and pour into a saucepan. Add the remaining milk, lemon peel and sugar, then bring to a boil. Lower to a medium-low heat and whisk continuously until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon (around 8-10 mins).</li>
                <li>Squeeze any excess water out of the gelatine, then stir into the warm milk mixture to dissolve. Set aside to cool down for 5 mins. Discard the lemon peel, pour the mixture into the prepared jelly mould and put in the fridge to set overnight.</li>
                <li>When ready to serve, bring a kettle of water to the boil and pour into a large heatproof bowl. Dip the mould in the water, holding it there for 1 min. Turn the blancmange out onto a serving plate, and top with a handful of fresh berries, if you like.</li>
            </ol>
